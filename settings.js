// If you're using Local by Flywheel you will
// want your settings to be similar to the examples below:

exports.themeLocation = './app/';

// exports.urlToPreview = 'http://jim-mathes.local/';
exports.urlToPreview = 'http://127.0.0.1:5500/app/index.html';

// Simply remove the two slashes at the front of those lines
// to uncomment them and then delete lines #1 and #2.

// Be SURE to update urlToPreview to YOUR domain and not mine.
// Be SURE to update themeLocation to YOUR theme folder name
